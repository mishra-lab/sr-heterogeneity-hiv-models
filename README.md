# Scoping Review:
## Heterogeneity and mixing in dynamical models of HIV transmission

*part of JK PhD*

### Research Questions
1. In which contexts (geographies, populations, time periods) within *Sub-Saharan Africa*, and for what applications (research questions) have HIV transmission models been used?
2. What parameterizations have been used to represent risk heterogeneity and mixing in *deterministic ompartmental* HIV transmission models?
3. How and why are particular parameterizations of risk heterogeneity and mixing in *deterministic ompartmental* HIV transmission models associated with specific contexts and applications within *Sub-Saharan Africa*?
