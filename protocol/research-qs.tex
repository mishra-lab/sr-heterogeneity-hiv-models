  \item\label{q:context}
  In which contexts (geographies, populations, time periods)
  within \ssa, and
  for what applications (research questions)
  have \hiv transmission models been used?
  \item\label{q:hetero}
  What parameterizations have been used
  to represent risk heterogeneity and mixing
  in \emph{deterministic compartmental} \hiv transmission models
  applied to \ssa?
  \item\label{q:trends}
  How and why are particular parameterizations of risk heterogeneity and mixing
  in \emph{deterministic compartmental} \hiv transmission models
  associated with specific contexts and applications within \ssa?
