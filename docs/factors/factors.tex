\\
\midrule
\multicolumn{6}{l}{Biological}
\\
\midrule
  HIV Infection
& Acute Infection
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Increased transmission probability immediately following infection
& \down
& Acute infection transmissions are unlikely to be prevented by ART
\\
  HIV Infection
& Late Stage
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Increased transmission probability during late stage (symptomatic) phase
& \up
& Late-stage transmissions are more lilely to be prevented by ART
\\
  HIV Infection
& Drug Resistance
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Factor (possibly transmitted) that delays viral suppression among a population subset
& \down
& Transmissions during longer delay to achieving viral suppression will not be prevented by ART
\\
  Sex Acts
& Gender Differences
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Biological differences in transmission probability are considered (higher susceptibility among women)
& \unclear
& Unclear
\\
  Sex Acts
& Circumcision
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Decreased transmission probability (lower susceptiblity among men)
& \unclear
& Unclear
\\
  Sex Acts
& Anal Sex
& Trans Prob Per Act; N Acts
& Anal sex is considered, with higher receptive transmission probability
& \down
& If higher risk groups practice anal sex more; then higher risk heterogeneity increases R0 and the challenge of epidemic control
\\
  Sex Acts
& STI Co-Infection
& Trans Prob Per Act
& Increased transmission probability due to coinfection
& \down
& If disproportionately affecting higher risk groups, then higher risk heterogeneity increases R0 and the challenge of epidemic control
\\
  HIV Infection
& HIV Mortality
& Mortality Rate
& Increased HIV/AIDS associated mortality at during late-stage disease
& \down
& Reduced mortality via ART could increase the overall HIV prevalence
\\
\midrule
\multicolumn{6}{l}{Social}
\\
\midrule
  HIV Infection
& HIV Morbidity
& Partner Rate; N Acts
& Reduced sexual activity associated with symptomatic HIV/AIDS during late stage disease
& \up
& Reduced morbidity via ART could increase HIV prevalence among sexually active population
\\
  Population Strata
& Age
& Partner Rate; Condom Use
& Any stratification defined by age
& \unclear
& Unclear
\\
  Population Strata
& Activity
& Partner Rate; Condom Use
& Any stratification defined by rate of partnership formation
& \down
& Higher risk heterogeneity increases R0 and the challenge of epidemic control
\\
  Population Strata
& Key Populations
& Partner Rate; Condom Use
& Any epidemiologically defined higher risk groups, including: FSW, Clients, MSM, PWID, AGYW
& \down
& Higher risk heterogeneity increases R0 and the challenge of epidemic control
\\
  Turnover
& Population
& Birth Rate; Mortality Rate
& Individuals enter into and exit from the overall population, reflecting the lifecourse of sexual activity
& \down
& Replacement of virally suppressed individuals ceasing sexual activity with susceptible individuals entering sexual activity could make ART coverage more difficult to achieve
\\
  Turnover
& Activity; Key Pops
& Internal Turnover
& Individuals move between activity groups and/or key populations
& \mixed
& Lower risk heterogeneity as cumulative exposure to risk experienced by any one individual is reduced; but viral suppression may be achieved only after periods of highest risk
\\
  Mixing
& Age
& Mixing Matrix
& Any assortative or semi-assortative mixing by age group, including older men with younger women
& \unclear
& Unclear
\\
  Mixing
& Activity
& Mixing Matrix
& Any assortative mixing by activity group and/or key populations
& \down
& Higher risk heterogeneity increases R0 and the challenge of epidemic control
\\
  Partnership Types
& Duration; Condom Use
& N Acts
& Some partnership types (casual, sex work) have decreased volume of sex and/or higher condom use versus other partnership types (steady)
& \up
& If only higher risk groups form such partnerships, then risk heterogeneity is reduced versus assuming all partnerships are equal
\\
  Partnership Types
& Concurrent Types
& Partner Rate
& Partnership types are not defined by the risk groups involved, so e.g.\ higher risk groups can form steady partnerships too
& \down
& Higher risk heterogeneity versus assuming higher risk groups cannot form steady partnerships
\\
\midrule
\multicolumn{6}{l}{Intervention}
\\
\midrule
  Behaviour Change
& HIV Counselling
& Partner Rate; Condom Use
& Reduced sexual activity / increased condom use associated with HIV diagnosis
& \up
& Increased HIV testing as part of ART scale-up can contribute to prevention benefits even before viral suppression is achieved
\\
  Behaviour Change
& Risk Compensation
& Partner Rate; Condom Use
& Increased sexual activity / reduced condom use associated with ART (before or after viral suppression)
& \down
& Higher risk bevhaviour, especially before achieving viral suppression, could increas transmission risk
\\
  Historical
& Any Prevention
& Multiple
& Any increase in prevention interventions reflecting observed trends
& \down
& Declining incidence due to other interventions reduces the potential for ART prevention benefit
\\
  Historical
& ART 
& Testing; Initiation; Viral Suppression Rates
& Any increase in ART coverage reflecting observed trends
& \down
& Declining incidence due to other interventions reduces the potential for additional ART prevention benefit
\\
  Combination
& Any Prevention
& Multiple
& Any increase in prevention interventions reflecting projected trends
& \down
& Declining incidence due to other interventions reduces the potential for additional ART prevention benefit
\\
  Gaps
& ART 
& Testing; Initiation; Viral Suppression Rates
& Differential ART cascade coverage across activity groups and/or key populations, where higher risk groups have lower coverage
& \down
& Lower viral suppression among higher risk groups specifically could allow higher volumes of onward transmission to persist
