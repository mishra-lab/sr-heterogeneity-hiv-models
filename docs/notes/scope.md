# Revising the scope of the Review (Manuscript)

## Background

### Motivations of the review
1. Support justification of thesis research chapters
  a. modelling HIV transmission focused on AGYW & pre-FSW
    - unique transmission vulnerabilities
    - barriers to engagement in prevention care
  b. modelling gaps in ART coverage
    - who do gaps represent?
    - 

2. Highlight
  - population-level mismatch in prevention impact (ART, PrEP)

### Existing reviews
- [Case2019] The impact, cost and cost-effectiveness of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review of modelling contributions and way forward
  - n = 44
  - Quality assessment re:
    1. updated PrEP assumptions
    2. cost-effectiveness standards
    3. two studies similar results
    4. rigor of modelling analysis
  - Effectiveness & Cost (numeric outcomes)
  - Examined prioritization to SDC, AGYW (n ~ 9), FSW, MSM

## Possible Revised Focus

0. Risk heterogeneity "overview"
  - parametrizations of all 3 different dimensions of heterogeneity:
    1. biological (infection stages, susceptibility, MC)
    2. behavioural (risk groups, partnerships, )
    3. access (intervention gaps)

1. Modelling behavioural risk heterogeneity
  - context: reach of combination interventions
  - data:
    - risk groups
      - defining features & implications for interventions
      - size & relative risk among groups
    - partnership types
    - Gini coefficient?
    - turnover
  - challenge:
    - relative risk:
      - changes over time with: interventions, HIV prevalence
      - multiple non-linear contributing factors
    - mile-wide inch-deep
      - when is heterogeneity important -- depends on RQ!

2. Risk heterogeneity in the context of ART scale-up
  - context: Why might ART scale-up fail?
    - cascade gaps parallel risk factors
      - testing, initiation, adherence
    - contribution of acute infection to transmission
      - or other susceptibility factors (STI, lube, AI)
  - Papers subset:
    - assess ART intervention impact
    - deterministic
  - Data:
    - factors possibly affecting ART impact
      - early HIV infection
      - risk-associated cascade gaps
      - behavioural changes after testing
      - degree of heterogeneity
    - explicit modelling of care cascade steps
    - inclusion of any risk heterogeneity
    - calibration to stratified data:
      - cascade, HIV incidence/prevalence

- Other scope reductions?
  - only models assessing interventions?
  - only deterministic models?
