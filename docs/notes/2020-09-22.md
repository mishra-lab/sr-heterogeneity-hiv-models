# Agenda
- review project scope & timelines: paper vs thesis
- review FSW definition
- results so far
  - summary stats
  - interventions vs pops & combination interventions

# Discussion & Decisions
- What to do about "kind of" key pops?
  - e.g. Abbas2007
    - 100 x more partners, size: .002 female, .044 male, never names "FSW" etc.
  - e.g. Hallett2009
    - 10-100 x partners, size: .01 - .4 female
  - e.g. Cremin2015
  - DECIDED:
    - 3 criteria for "FSW" -- *justify w epi refs
      1. at least 50* x partners
      2. at most 2%* of female pop
      3. ideally more FSW than Cli? -- what if named "FSW/Cli" papers don't use this?
    - perhaps include all 3 in data extraction
    - what about prior ranges?
- Target Journals (no order): AIDS, JAIDS, JAIS

# Action Items
## Now
1. Review definitions of scoping vs systematic review - which are we?

2. git push paper as is
  - Key messages at top
  - discussion bullets
  - 
## Later
- Box of definitions used for the review w epi evidence
- Figure 3: "study" -> "simulated intervention"
- Figure 4: define "gray=0" and zero-out diagonal (confusing)
- Define different "N": study, intervention, int-pop, model
- show "structural" interventions (mostly zero) to make a point?
- short acronym definitions
- Figure 4 text (and elsewhere): use N/N
