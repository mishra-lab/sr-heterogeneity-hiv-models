% JK: these are possible key messages as the paper is framed currently,
%     but may change if the scope/focus changes
\begin{enumerate}
        % JK: These first two seem kind of lame
        %     but what else to say when it is a big summary of what's been done?
  \item HIV transmission models have been used to answer a variety of research questions,
        though most have focused on projecting the population-level transmission
        impacts of current and future interventions.
  \item Parameterizations of heterogeneity in social, biological, and intervention dimensions
        of simulated populations have also varied widely.
        % JK: I feel like we could try to say something about: not always clear justification?
        %     But that could get messy if we try to extract justifications...
  \item Among modelling studies of the transmission benefits of \art treatment as prevention (\tasp):
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item several have assumed homogeneity in social elements of transmission risk;
          % and/or did not model increased infectivity associated with acute \hiv infection;
    \item even among models with transmission risk heterogeneity, most assumed
          homogeneity in intervention scale-up and coverage.
  \end{enumerate}
        In reality, heterogeneity in transmission risk
        can make it harder control an epidemic via \tasp,
        and often overlaps with barriers to achieving viral suppression.
        Thus, such assumptions may lead to overestimated transmission impact of \tasp.
        % TODO: add something about data (priors & calibration) here?
  \item Few modelling studies have explicitly modelled the unique vulnerabilities faced by
        some adolescent girls and young women (beyond older male partners),
        particularly in the context of transactional sex, such as
        higher rates of violence and lower condom use, as well as
        barriers to accessing prevention tools.
        % TODO: something about keeping up with historical intervention context?
        % TODO: something about turnover?
