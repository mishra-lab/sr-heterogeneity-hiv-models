%increasing risk heterogeneity,
%such as acute infection stage and key populations,
%can reduce the projected impact of \utt interventions \cite{Hontelez2013},
%while simulation of concurrent interventions can
%reduce the relative projected impact of new interventions
%as incidence is already declining \cite{Hontelez2013}.

The objectives of our review were to answer the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{q:context}
  In which contexts (geographies, populations, time periods)
  within \ssa, and
  for what applications (research questions)
  have \hiv transmission models been used?
  \item\label{q:hetero}
  What parameterizations have been used
  to represent risk heterogeneity
  in \emph{deterministic compartmental} \hiv transmission models
  applied to \ssa?
  \item\label{q:trends}
  How and why are particular parameterizations of risk heterogeneity and mixing
  in \emph{deterministic compartmental} \hiv transmission models
  associated with specific contexts and applications within \ssa?
\end{enumerate}
