\begin{itemize}
  \item we found (brief): large variability in application of transmission models,
  and parameterization of risk heterogeneity w.r.t. biological, social, and intervention dimensions
  \item brief context of heterogeneity importance:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item core group theory: explosive growth, lower endemic equilibrium
    \item more difficult to ``control'' (higher $R_0$)
  \end{itemize}
  \item TasP studies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item inspired by individual-level prevention benefits (U=U) \& push for 90-90-90:
          large interest in scaling up \art coverage
    \item many studies explored possible transmission benefits
    \item however: 4 important assumptions often made:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item no acute infection -- could represent
            a substantial proportion of infections ``unpreventable'' via \tasp
      \item homogeneity in risk -- core group theory \& model comparison studies suggest
            risk heterogeneity makes epidemic harder to control
      \item no turnover -- could thus overestimate
            the ease of reaching high \art coverage in risk groups with high turnover
            given delays in linkage and viral suppression
      \item homogeneity in intervention coverage -- could overestimate impact
            as challenges to increasing cascade in key populations are overlooked
    \end{itemize}
    \item overall: could result in overestimation of the transmission impact of \tasp
    \item some ideas above may be generalizable to other interventions
          % JK: but I need to think more deeply...
  \end{itemize}
  \item AGYW \& Transactional sex:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item was rarely explicitly modelled
          (defined: lower condom use, higher transmission probability, violence, barriers to accessing prevention tools)
    \item FSW were modelled often, including prioritized interventions to FSW
    \item but: emerging evidence of access gap that parallels periods of potentially highest transmission risk
    \item represents important gap in modelling literature
  \end{itemize}
  \item challenges to parameterizing heterogeneity
  \begin{itemize}
    \item biological
    \begin{itemize}
      \item debate over the importance, duration/size, \& variability of acute phase
    \end{itemize}
    \item behavioural:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item lack of data:
            number of studies (due to cost),
            internal (reliability),
            and external (representativeness) of studies.
      \item difficulty of stratifying calibration targets (prevalence, incidence)
            by risk groups for the same reasons
      \item amplified challenges for key populations
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item similar challenges for stratified intervention engagement data
      \item costing \& engagement highly context/implementation-specific (HTPN)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
% JK: not sure how to wrap it up...
\end{itemize}
