We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews
(see Appendix~\ref{a:prisma} for checklist).
First, we developed a conceptual framework to organize
the assumptions and representations of risk heterogeneity
in compartmental HIV transmission models.
Then, we designed and implemented the search strategy,
and extracted the data relevant to the framework
to address the objectives.
% ==============================================================================
\subsection{Conceptual Framework for Risk Heterogeneity}
\label{ss:meth:framework}
We conceptualized ``factors of risk heterogeneity'', meaning
epidemiological stratifications and phenomena which may/not be included in transmission models.
Such factors could include if/how populations, rates, and probabilities
are stratified along health, structural, and behavioural dimensions.
We defined the following 4 domains in which
different factors of risk heterogeneity might influence the transmission impact of ART.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Biological Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within HIV disease course
  that may coincide with differential ART coverage
  \cite{Pilcher2004}
  \item \textbf{Behaviour Change Effects:}
  differential transmission risk due to
  behavioural changes related to engagement in the ART cascade
  \cite{Ramachandran2016,Tiwari2020}
  \item \textbf{Network Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within sub-populations
  that increase the challenge of epidemic control through core group dynamics
  \cite{Anderson1986,Boily1997,Watts2010,Dodd2010}
  \item \textbf{Coverage Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within sub-populations
  who also experience barriers to engaging in ART care and achieving viral suppression,
  such as youth and key populations
  \cite{Mountain2014,Lancaster2016,Hakim2018,Green2020}
\end{itemize}
We then compiled a list of key factors of risk heterogeneity,
and their possible mechanisms of influence on ART prevention impact (Table~\ref{tab:factors}).

\subsection{Search}
\label{ss:meth:search}
We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid
using search terms related to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV, and transmission modelling
(Appendix~\ref{aa:search:terms}).
Search results were imported into Covidence \cite{Covidence} for screening.
Duplicate studies were removed automatically by Ovid and by Covidence;
four additional duplicates that were not identified automatically,
possibly due to subtly different titles, were later identified and removed manually.
Potentially relevant studies were identified by title and abstract screening, followed 
by full-text screening using the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below. 
One reviewer (JK) conducted the search, screening, and data extraction.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria}
\label{sss:meth:criteria}
We included peer-reviewed, primarily modelling studies that used non-linear models of sexual HIV transmission
to project the prevention impacts of ART in any one or more settings within SSA.
Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are given in Appendix~\ref{aa:search:criteria}.
We only included studies communicated in English and published anytime before Jan 1, 2020.
We excluded publications without primary modelling results and description of the methods,
such as commentaries and reviews.
We excluded conference publications.
If a model's details were provided in a separate peer-reviewed publication,
we extracted data from both publications as required.
\par
The following criteria were used for inclusion of studies:
1) Used a non-linear compartmental model of
sexual HIV transmission at the population level.
We defined a \emph{non-linear model} as one where
the number of infections projected at time $t$ is a function of
the number of infections previously projected by the model before time $t$ \cite{Garnett2011}.
We defined a \emph{compartmental model} as one where
the system variables represent the numbers of individuals in each state,
rather than unique individuals \cite{Garnett2011}.
Thus, statistical models, linear models, and individual-based models without dynamic transmission were excluded.
2) The model was calibrated or parameterized to reflect at least one setting within SSA
(see Appendix~\ref{aa:defs:context} for full country list).
3) The study simulated at least one scenario with increasing ART coverage,
possibly alongside scale-up of other interventions.
The included studies formed Dataset~A,
used to complete objectives \ref{rq:1}~and~\ref{rq:2}.
\par
A subset of Dataset~A formed Dataset~B,
which used to complete objective~\ref{rq:3}.
Studies in Dataset~B specifically examined
scale-up of ART coverage alone (versus combination intervention)
for the whole population (versus ART prioritized to subgroups),
and reported HIV incidence reduction or cumulative HIV infections averted over time 
as compared to a base-case scenario reflecting the status quo.
% ==============================================================================
\subsection{Data Extraction}
\label{ss:meth:data}
Data extraction used the full text and all available supplementary material.
For objectives \ref{rq:1}~and~\ref{rq:2}, data were extracted per-study.
For objective~\ref{rq:3}, data were extracted per-scenario within the study.
Variables definitions are given in Appendix~\ref{a:defs}.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Epidemic Context}
\label{sss:meth:context}
For objective~\ref{rq:1}, we extracted data on
geography, epidemic phase, and key populations explicitly considered in the model.
We categorized studies by the geographic location (country and SSA region),
scale of the simulated population (city, sub-national, national, regional), and
whether the study included multiple geographic settings.
We classified epidemic size at time of ART intervention using
the overall HIV prevalence at that time (low: $<$1\%, medium: 1-10\%, high: $>$10\%),
and classified epidemic phase at the time of ART intervention
using the trend in incidence at that time
(increasing, increasing but stabilizing, stable/equilibrium, decreasing but stabilizing, and decreasing).
\par
We extracted whether any of the following key populations were included in the model:
female sex workers (FSW);
male clients of FSW (Clients);
men who have sex with men (MSM); and
people who inject drugs (PWID).
FSW were defined as any female activity group meeting 3 criteria:
{$<$5\%} of the female population;
{$<$1/3} the size of the client population; and
having {$>$50$\times$} the partners per year of
the lowest sexually active female activity group \cite{Vandepitte2006,Scorgie2012}.
Likewise, clients were defined as any male activity group
described as clients of FSW and being {$>$3$\times$} the size of the FSW population.
We also extracted whether any groups in the model were described as MSM or PWID.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Factors of Risk Heterogeneity}
\label{sss:meth:factors}
For objective~\ref{rq:2}, we examined if and how
the factors of risk heterogeneity outlined in Table~\ref{tab:factors}
were simulated in each study.
Special focus was given to the factors related to Network and Coverage Effects,
due to the large variability in how these factors were simulated.
We examined the number of \emph{risk groups} defined by sex and/or sexual activity, and
any \emph{turnover} of individuals between activity groups and/or key populations.
\par
We extracted whether multiple \emph{partnership types} were simulated,
and classified how such partnerships were defined:
generic (all partnerships equal);
based only on the activity groups involved;
or overlapping, such that different partnership types could be formed between the same two activity groups.
We extracted whether partnerships considered different
numbers of sex acts (sex frequency and partnership duration) and levels of condom use.
We extracted whether models simulated any degree of assortative \emph{mixing} by activity groups
(preference for like-with-like) versus proportionate (random mixing). 
The number of unique \emph{age groups} was extracted, as well as
whether \emph{mixing} by age groups was
proportionate, strictly assortative, or assortative with age differences.
We extracted whether age conferred any additional risk beyond mixing,
such as higher rates of partnership formation.
\par
Finally, we extracted whether rates of HIV diagnosis, ART initiation, and/or ART discontinuation
differed across modelled risk strata (sex, activity, key populations, and/or age),
and if so, how they differed.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{ART Prevention Impact}
\label{sss:meth:api}
For objective~\ref{rq:3}, we examined the subset of studies (Dataset~B)
reporting incidence reduction and/or infections averted due to
a population-wide ART scale-up intervention.
We extracted the following data for each intervention scenario within Dataset~B:
the years that ART scale-up started (\tx{0}) and stopped (\tx{f});
the final overall ART coverage achieved and/or
the final ART initiation rate (per person-year among PLHIV not yet in care);
the criteria for ART initiation (e.g.\ CD4 count);
and the relative reduction in transmission probability on ART.
Then, we extracted the
reduction in incidence relative to the base-case scenario, and/or
proportion of infections averted relative to the base-case scenario
for available time horizons relative to \tx{0}.
\par
Finally, for each factor of heterogeneity,
we compared the projected ART impacts (incidence reduction and infections averted)
across the different factor levels (whether or not, and how the factor was modelled).
We plotted the impacts versus time since \tx{0}, stratified by factor levels,
and explored whether the distribution of impacts
was the same under all factor levels.
We tested for significant differences using a Kruskal-Wallis test.
