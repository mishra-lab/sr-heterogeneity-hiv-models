  \tnt[2]{We define a \emph{non-linear model} as one where

    the number of infections previously projected by the model before time $t$.}
  \tnt[3]{We define a \emph{compartmental model} as one where
    the system variables represent the numbers of individuals in each state,

  \tnt[4]{SSA was defined based on the countries in
    the UN regions of East, South, Central, and West Africa, plus South Sudan
    (see Table~\ref{tab:search} for full country list).
    Studies were included if the model was parameterized/calirated to reflect
    at least one context within SSA.
    Only model parameters \& outcomes for SSA contexts were extracted.}
