  \toprule
  \textbf{Factor}
& \textbf{MP\tn{a}}
& \textbf{Definition}
& \textbf{Possible mechanism(s) of influence on ART prevention impact}
\\
\midrule
  Acute Infection
& $\beta_i$
& Increased infectiousness immediately following infection\cite{Pilcher2004}
& \emph{Biological}: transmissions during acute infection are unlikely to be prevented by ART
\\
  Late Stage Infection
& $\beta_i$
& Increased infectiousness during late stage infection
& \emph{Biological}: transmissions during late-stage are more likely to be prevented by ART
\\
  Drug Resistance
& $\beta_i$
& Transmitted factor that requires regimen switch to achieve viral suppression
& \emph{Biological}: transmissions during longer delay to achieving viral suppression will not be prevented by ART
\\
\midrule
  HIV Mortality % ~ always included: remove?
& $\mu$
& Increased HIV/AIDS-associated mortality during late-stage disease\cite{}
& \emph{Epidemic}: reduced mortality via ART could increase the overall HIV prevalence\cite{Salomon2005}
\\
  Population Turnover % ~ always included: remove?
& $\nu$; $\mu$
& Individuals enter into and exit from the sexually active population reflecting sexual lifecourse
& \emph{Epidemic}: net replacement of exiting virally suppressed individuals with entering susceptible individuals
could require greater ART initiation rates for the same coverage
\\
  Concurrent Interventions
& varies
& Any increase in prevention interventions reflecting observed or projected trends
& \emph{Epidemic}: Declining incidence due to prevention interventions could reduce the potential for ART prevention benefit
\\
\midrule
  HIV Morbidity
& $c$; $\eta$
& Reduced sexual activity during late stage disease\cite{}
& \emph{Behavioural}: reduced morbidity via ART could increase HIV prevalence among the sexually active population
\\
  HIV Counselling
& $c$; $\kappa$
& Reduced sexual activity and/or increased condom use after HIV diagnosis
& \emph{Behavioural}: increased HIV testing with ART scale up can contribute to prevention even before viral suppression is achieved
\\
  Risk Compensation
& $c$; $\kappa$
& Increased sexual activity and/or reduced condom use after ART initiation
& \emph{Behavioural}: increased risk behaviour before achieving viral suppression could increase transmission risk
\\
\midrule
  Activity Groups
& $c$; $\kappa$
& Any stratification by rate of partnership formation
& \emph{Network}: higher transmission risk among higher activity
\\
  Key~Populations
& $c$; $\kappa$
& Any epidemiologically defined higher risk groups, including: FSW, Clients, MSM, PWID, AGYW
& \emph{Network \& Coverage} higher transmission risk and barriers to viral suppression among key populations\cite{}
\\
  Age Groups
& $c$; $\kappa$
& Any stratification by age
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: higher transmission risk and barriers to viral suppression among youth\cite{}
\\
  Internal Turnover
& $\phi$
& Individuals move between activity groups and/or key populations reflecting sexual lifecourse
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: counteract effect of stratification due to shorter periods in higher risk;\cite{}
viral suppression may be achieved only after periods of higher risk
\\
  Assortative Mixing
& $m$
& Any degree of assortative mixing by age, activity, and/or key populations
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: assortative sexual networks compound effect of stratification\cite{}
\\
  Partnership Types
& $\eta$; $\kappa$
& Different partnership types are simulated, with different volumes of sex and/or condom usage
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: generally shorter duration and higher condom use among higher risk partnerships
\\
  Anal Sex
& $\beta_s$; $\eta$
& Anal sex is simulated, with higher receptive transmission probability\cite{Baggaley2018}
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: higher prevalence of anal sex among key populations\cite{Owen2017}
\\
  STI Infection
& $\beta_i$; $\beta_s$
& Increased transmission probability due to STI infection\cite{}
& \emph{Network \& Coverage}: higher prevalence of STI coincides with higher sexual activity\cite{}
\\
  ART Cascade Gaps
& $\tau$; $\alpha$
& Lower ART cascade coverage among higher risk groups or key populations\cite{}
& \emph{Coverage}: ART prevention benefits may be allocated among lowest risk
