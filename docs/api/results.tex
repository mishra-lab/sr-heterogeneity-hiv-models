The search yielded 1384 publications,
of which 94 studies were included
(Figure~\ref{fig:prisma}).
360 studies used non-linear HIV transmission models applied to SSA, of which
255 were compartmental models. 
94 compartmental modeling studies simulated ART scale-up (Database~A), of which
40 reported infections averted or incidence reduction
due to population-wide ART scale-up without additional combination interventions,
as compared to a base case reflecting status quo (Database~B).
Appendix~\ref{aa:search:database} lists the included papers, and
Appendix~\ref{a:results} provides additional results.

\subsection{Epidemic Context}
\label{ss:res:context}
Table~\ref{tab:summary} summarizes the key features of contexts within SSA
where the prevention impacts of ART have been modelled.
Most (\x{geo/n.any.nat}) of the 94 studies modelled HIV transmission at the national level,
including \x{geo/n.nat} single-country and \x{geo/n.nat.multi} multi-country analyses.
Studies also explored
regional (\x{geo/n.any.sub.ssa}),
sub-national (\x{geo/n.any.sub.nat}), and
city-level (\x{geo/n.any.city}) epidemic scales.
South Africa was the most common country simulated (\x{co/n.South-Africa} studies),
but was not disproportionately represented among SSA countries:
the number of studies per million PLHIV as of 2019 in South Africa (\x{co/mph.South-Africa})
was similar to the SSA median (\x{co/mph.med}).
Figure~\ref{fig:map} illustrates the number of studies by country.
East Africa was the most represented SSA region being simulated in \x{co/n.re.east} studies,
followed by Southern (\x{co/n.re.south}), Central (\x{co/n.re.central}), and West Africa (\x{co/n.re.west}).

  \label{fig:map}
\end{figure}
\par
ART prevention impacts were most often modelled in
high-prevalence epidemics ({$>$10\%} HIV prevalence, \x{t0/n.prev.High} studies) and
medium-prevalence epidemics ({1-10\%}, \x{t0/n.prev.Mid} studies).
No studies reported overall HIV prevalence of {$<$1\%} at time of ART scale-up,
although for \x{t0/n.prev.NA} studies, HIV prevalence was either
not reported or varied across independently simulated contexts/scenarios.
The \xdmdef year of scenario ART scale-up was \xdm{t0/t0}; at which time
HIV prevalence (\%) was \xdm{t0/prev}; and
incidence (per 1000 PY) was \xdm{t0/inc}.
Most contexts reporting incidence trends had decreasing or stable incidence
(45 of 48 reporting). % MAN \x{t0/n.phase.*}
\subsubsection{Key Populations}
\label{sss:res:kp}
Groups representing FSW were described in \x{kp/n.FSW.named} studies.
Among these (of studies where it was possible to evaluate):
\x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.p} (of \x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.p.v}) were {$<$5\%} of the female population;
\x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.pr} (of \x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.pr.v}) were {$<$1/3} the size of the client population; and
\x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.cr} (of \x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.cr.v}) had {$>$50$\times$} the partners per year of
the lowest sexually active female activity group.
In \x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.fail} studies at least one criteria was not met, and
in \x{kp/n.FSW.n.crit.3} all three were met.
Clients of FSW were modelled as a unique group in \x{kp/n.Cli.named} studies,
among which \x{kp/n.Cli.n.crit} (of \x{kp/n.Cli.n.crit.v} reporting)
were {$>$3$\times$} the size of the FSW population.
In another \x{kp/n.Cli.named.p}, studies clients were defined as a proportion of another group,
among which \x{kp/n.Cli.n.p.crit} (of \x{kp/n.Cli.n.p.crit.v})
were {$>$3$\times$} the size of the FSW population.
Activity groups described as representing
men who have sex with men (MSM) were noted in \x{kp/n.MSM} studies; and
people who inject drugs (PWID) in \x{kp/n.PWID}.

\subsection{Heterogeneity Factors}
\label{ss:res:factors}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Biological Effects}
\label{sss:res:bio}
The \xdmdef number of states used to represent HIV disease
(ignoring treatment-related stratifications) was \xdm{hiv/hiv.n},
and \x{hiv/n.hiv.cts} studies represented HIV along a continuous dimension
using a partial differential equations model.
Most HIV states were defined by CD4 count
to reflect clinical progression and/or historical ART eligibility,
often with additional states to represent acute infection and/or development of AIDS.
States of increased infectiousness associated with acute infection and late stage disease
were simulated in \x{hiv/n.hiv.acute} and \x{hiv/n.hiv.late} studies, respectively.
\par
The relative risk of HIV transmission on ART was \xdm{art/rbeta},
representing an average ``on-treatment'' state in \x{art/n.rbeta.x.T} studies,
versus a ``virally suppressed'' state specifically in \x{art/n.rbeta.x.V} studies.
Treatment failure due to drug resistance was simulated in \x{art/n.art.fail.any} studies, including:
\x{art/n.art.x.fail} in which individuals experiencing treatment failure
were tracked separately from ART-naive; and
\x{art/n.art.r.fail} in which such individuals
transitioned back to a generic ``off-treatment'' state.
Another \x{art/n.art.r.frop} studies included a similar transition
that was not clearly identified as treatment failure versus ART cessation.
Transmissible drug resistance was simulated in \x{art/n.tdr} studies.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Behavioural Effects}
\label{sss:res:beh}
Reduced sexual activity during late-stage HIV symptoms was simulated in \x{hiv/n.hiv.morb.any} studies,
including at least one state with:
complete cessastion of sexual activity (\x{hiv/n.hiv.morb.inact});
reduced rate or number of partnerships (\x{hiv/n.hiv.morb.np}); and/or
reduced rate or number of sex acts per partnership (\x{hiv/n.hiv.morb.vol}).
\par
Separate health states representing diagnosed HIV but not yet on treatment
and on treatment but not yet virally suppressed were simulated in
\x{art/n.art.x.dx} and \x{art/n.art.x.vlus} studies, respectively.
\x{art/n.bc.any} studies modelled changes in behaviour following awareness of HIV status among PLHIV:
increased condom use (\x{art/n.bc.cond.any});
fewer partners per year (\x{art/n.dx.bc.np});
fewer sex acts per partnership (\x{art/n.dx.bc.vol});
serosorting (\x{art/n.dx.bc.ss}); and/or
a generic reduction in transmission probability (\x{art/n.dx.bc.gen}).
\par
ART cessation was simulated in \x{art/n.art.drop.any} studies, including:
\x{art/n.art.x.drop} in which individuals no longer on ART
were tracked separately from ART-naive; and
\x{art/n.art.r.drop} in which such individuals
transitioned back to a generic ``off-treatment'' state.
Another \x{art/n.art.r.frop} studies included a similar transition
that was not clearly identified as treatment failure versus ART cessation.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsubsection{Network Effects}
\label{sss:res:network}
Representations of risk heterogeneity varied widely.
Risk groups defined at least in part by activity
(different rates and/or types of partnerships formed) were simulated in \x{act/n.act.def.np} studies,
and at least in part by sex in \x{act/n.act.def.sex} studies.
The number of simulated groups defined by sex and/or activity was \xdm{act/act.n};
the number defined by activity alone (maximum number of groups among either
heterosexual women, heterosexual men, MSM, or overall if sex was not considered) was \xdm{act/act.n.z}.
The highest activity groups (including FSW and clients, where applicable) for females and males comprised
\xdm{act/hrw.p} and \xdm{act/hrm.p}~\% of female and male populations, respectively.
\par
Turnover between activity groups and/or key populations
was considered in \x{act/n.turnover.any} studies,
of which \x{act/n.turnover.high} considered turnover of only
one specific high-activity group or key population.
Another \x{act/n.turnover.repl} studies simulated
movement only from lower activity groups into higher activity groups
to re-balance group sizes against disproportionate HIV mortality in higher activity groups.
\par
Among \x{act/n.act.def.np} studies with activity groups, sexual mixing was assumed to be
assortative in \x{pt/n.mix.asso} and proportionate in \x{pt/n.mix.prop}.
Regarding the three approaches to partnership types:
First, partnerships were considered to have equal probability of transmission in
\x{pt/n.pt.gen} studies, including all studies without activity groups.
Second, partnerships were defined by the activity groups involved (\x{pt/n.pt.grp} studies).
In such partnerships, transmission was usually
lower in high-with-high activity partnerships than in low-with-low, due to a combination of
fewer sex acts (\x{pt/n.grp.vol}) and
increased condom use (\x{pt/n.grp.condom}).
The transmission risk in mixed high-with-low activity partnerships was defined by:
the susceptible partner (\x{pt/n.act.drive.sus});
the lower activity partner (\x{pt/n.act.drive.low});
the higher activity partner (\x{pt/n.act.drive.high}); or
the unique combination of both partners' activity groups (\x{pt/n.act.drive.mix});
such definitions yielded indeterminate, higher, lower, or intermediate
per-partnership transmission risk, respectively.
Third, partnerships could be defined based on overlapping types
(main/spousal, casual, and sex work), such that
different partnership types could be formed between the same two activity groups (\x{pt/n.pt.phen} studies).
For example, FSW could form commercial, casual, or spousal/main partnerships with clients.
All models with overlapping partnership types defined differential total sex acts and condom use between types.
\par
Age groups were simulated in \x{age/n.age.any} studies.
Among studies with age groups, the number of age groups was \xdm{age/age.n},
and \x{age/n.age.cts} studies simulated age along a continuous dimension.
Sexual mixing between age groups was assumed to be assortative
either with (\x{age/n.mix.offd}) or without (\x{age/n.mix.asso})
average age differences between men and women;
or proportionate (\x{age/n.mix.prop}).
Differential risk behaviour by age occurred in \x{age/n.risk} of these \x{age/n.age.any} studies.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Coverage Effects}
\label{sss:res:cov}
Differential transition rates along the ART cascade was considered in
\x{cov/n.diff.any.any} studies, including differences between
sexes in \x{cov/n.diff.any.sex};
age groups in \x{cov/n.diff.any.age}; and
key populations in \x{cov/n.diff.any.kp}.
No studies considered differences in cascade transition rates
among activity groups beyond key populations. % MAN
Another \x{cov/n.diff.any.any.j} studies did not simulate differential cascade transitions,
but specifically justified the simplification using data relevant to the simulated context.
Differences between sexes included rates of
HIV diagnosis (\x{cov/n.diff.dx.sex});
ART initiation (\x{cov/n.diff.art.i.sex}); and
ART cessation (\x{cov/n.diff.art.o.sex}),
with cascade engagement higher among women,
in most cases attributed to antenatal services.
Differences between age groups also affected
rates of diagnosis (\x{cov/n.diff.dx.age});
ART initiation (\x{cov/n.diff.art.i.age});
but not ART cessation (\x{cov/n.diff.art.o.age}). % MAN
Among key populations, \emph{lower} rates of
diagnosis, ART initiation, and retention were simulated in
\x{cov/n.diff.dx.kp}, \x{cov/n.diff.art.i.kp}, and \x{cov/n.diff.art.o.kp}
studies respectively, while \emph{higher} rates were simulated in
\x{cov/n.diff.dx.kp.H}, \x{cov/n.diff.art.i.kp.H}, and \x{cov/n.diff.art.o.kp.H}.
% ==============================================================================
\subsection{ART Prevention Impact}
\label{ss:res:api}
Dataset B comprised \x{n/n.a.api} studies,
including \x{n/n.s.api} scenarios of ART scale-up.
Relative incidence reduction with ART scale-up
as compared to a scenario without ART scale-up
was reported in \x{n/n.a.api.inc} studies (\x{n/n.s.api.inc} scenarios);
the proportion of cumulative infections averted due to ART scale-up
was reported in \x{n/n.a.api.chi} (\x{n/n.s.api.chi});
and \x{n/n.a.api.both} (\x{n/n.s.api.both}) reported both.
Some scenarios reported these outcomes on multiple time horizons.
Reported impact on incidence ranged from % MAN
93\% reduction over 10 years \cite{Granich2009} to
14\% increase over 15 years \cite{Salomon2005},
while impact on cumulative infections ranged from
78\% reduction over 10 years \cite{Abbas2006} to
12\% increase over 5 years \cite{Barnighausen2016}.
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:api} summarizes each outcome versus time since ART scale-up,
stratified by a composite index of modelled risk heterogeneity.
Ecological-level analysis across scenarios by degree of risk heterogeneity
identified differences in proportions of infections averted,
but not in relative incidence reduction (Table~\ref{tab:api}).
The largest proportions of infections averted were reported from 
scenarios without risk heterogeneity 
(median [IQR]\% = \xd{api/chi/Risk.None}), followed by scenarios
with key populations prioritized for ART (\xd{api/chi/Risk.KP-(priority)}).
The smallest impact was observed in scenarios with
key populations who were not prioritized for ART (\xd{api/chi/Risk.KP-(same)})
and in models with some risk heterogeneity but without key populations
(\xd{api/chi/Risk.Activity-(No-KP)}).
Only \x{n/n.s.api.both} scenarios from \x{n/n.a.api.both} studies provided both outcomes
\cite{Salomon2005,Abbas2006,Pretorius2010,Nichols2014,Barnighausen2016,Maheu-Giroux2017,Akudibillah2018}; % MAN
within which the pattern of incidence reduction versus modelled heterogeneity
was generally similar to the pattern of infections averted versus modelled heterogeneity
(Figure~\ref{fig:api:both}).

    The number of studies (scenarios) reporting
    incidence reduction, cumulative infections averted, both, or either was:
    \x{n/n.a.api.inc}~(\x{n/n.s.api.inc}),
    \x{n/n.a.api.chi}~(\x{n/n.s.api.chi}), 
    \x{n/n.a.api.both}~(\x{n/n.s.api.both}), and
    \x{n/n.a.api}~(\x{n/n.s.api}), respectively (Dataset~B).
    If any study included multiple scenarios of ART scale-up,
    then each scenario was included as a separate data point,
    but the size of each data point was reduced
    in proportion to the number of scenarios in the study.
    Some scenarios have multiple data points if multiple time horizons were reported.
    A small random offset was added to all data points to reduce overlap.
    KP: key populations;
    priority: cascade transitions were faster for at least one step among KP vs overall;
    same: cascade transitions were assumed the same speed in KP as overall;
    no scenarios in Dataset~B considered lower cascade among KP.}

Appendix~\ref{aa:res:api} and Table~\ref{tab:api} summarizes
the reported ART prevention impacts (relative incidence reduction and proportion of infections averted),
stratified by: other factors of risk heterogeneity; epidemic contexts; and intervention conditions.
For example, reported incidence reduction and proportion of infections averted
were both larger with longer time horizon, greater ART eligibility, and higher ART coverage.
