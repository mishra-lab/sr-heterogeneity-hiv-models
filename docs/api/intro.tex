Viral load suppression by antiretroviral therapy (ART)
has undisputed individual-level health benefits.
\autocite{}
Partner-based trials have also clearly demonstrated
prevention of HIV transmission via ART (undetectable = untransmittable).
\cite{Lundgren2015,Danel2015,Cohen2016} % Cohen 2011 NEJM?
Such demonstrations have complemented earlier model-based evidence of
``treatment as prevention'',\cite{Granich2009,Eaton2012} motivating
several large-scale community-based trials of universal test-and-treat.%

Unfortunately, universal test-and-treat without combination prevention interventions
did not significantly reduce HIV incidence in these trials.
\cite{Havlir2019,Hayes2019,Iwuji2018}
Proposed explanations for non-significance include:
participation bias;
poor linkage to care, possibly associated with stigma and accessibility;
concurrent cascade improvements in the control arm, including
expanded testing and ART eligibility;
mobility and sexual mixing outside study communities;
and possible de-emphasis of primary prevention.%
\cite{Havlir2019,Hayes2019,Iwuji2018,Baral2019}
These explanations highlight the potential challenges of
implementing ART as prevention at scale, particularly if
the unique treatment and prevention needs of at-risk populations
are not explicitly incorporated into ART scale-up;
that is, if heterogeneities in risk and access to care
are not sufficiently considered.

\par
Given the upstream and complementary role of transmission modelling
to project the impact of ART as prevention,\cite{Granich2009,Eaton2012}
we were motivated to critically appraise
assumptions and representations of risk heterogeneity
in earlier models assessing ART as prevention.
This appraisal might help explain the differences between
projected and observed ART prevention impacts.
For the appraisal, we considered ``factors of risk heterogeneity'',
meaning population stratifications and epidemiological phenomena
which may/not be included in transmission models.
We also defined the following 5 mechanisms
by which factors of risk heterogeneity might influence ART prevention impact.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Biological Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within HIV disease course
  that coincide with differential ART coverage
  \cite{Pilcher2004}
  \item \textbf{Network Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within sub-populations
  that increase the challenge of epidemic control through core group dynamics
  \cite{Anderson1986,Boily1997,Watts2010}
  \item \textbf{Coverage Effects:}
  differential transmission risk within sub-populations
  who also experience barriers to achieving viral suppression via ART,
  such as key populations
  \cite{Mountain2014,Lancaster2016,Hakim2018}
  \item \textbf{Behavioural Effects:}
  differential transmission risk due to
  behavioural changes related to engagement in the ART cascade
  \cite{} % JK: TODO
  \item \textbf{Epidemic Effects:}
  changes in the relative prevalence of people in each ART cascade step
  within the sexually active population
  \cite{} % JK: TODO
\end{itemize}
We then compiled a list of key factors of risk heterogeneity,
and their associated mechanisms of influence on ART prevention impact
(Table~\ref{tab:heterogeneity}).
Based on this list, we reviewed the model-based evidence of ART prevention impact
in order to answer the following research questions.
