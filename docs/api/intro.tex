The HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 included nearly one million new infections,
and approximately two thirds (25.7 million) of all people living with HIV globally.\cite{AIDSinfo}
Combating the epidemic requires combination prevention, including HIV treatment,
as recommended by the World Health Organization.\cite{WHO2016ART}
Effective HIV treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to
viral load suppression and has been shown to prevent HIV 
transmission between sex partners.\cite{Lundgren2015,Danel2015,Cohen2016} % + Cohen2011 ?
\par
Following empirical evidence of partnership-level efficacy of ART
in preventing HIV, \cite{Lundgren2015,Danel2015,Cohen2016}
and model-based evidence of ``treatment as prevention'',\cite{Granich2009,Eaton2012} % + Delva2012 ?
several large-scale community-based trials of universal test-and-treat (UTT)
have recently been completed.\cite{Iwuji2018,Havlir2019,Hayes2019} % + Tanser2013 ?
These trials found that over 2 to 4 years,
cumulative incidence under UTT did not significantly differ from
cumulative incidence under ART according to national guidelines.\cite{Havlir2019,Hayes2019,Iwuji2018}
Thus the population-level reductions in incidence anticipated from transmission modelling were not observed.
\par
One theme in the proposed explanations for limited population-level ART effectiveness
was heterogeneity in intervention coverage and transmission risks.\cite{AbdoolKarim2019,Baral2019}
While viral suppression improved under UTT in all three trials,
21--54\% of study participants remained unsuppressed.\cite{Iwuji2018,Havlir2019,Hayes2019}
Populations experiencing barriers to viral suppression under UTT
may be at highest risk for onward transmission, such as
individuals with acute infection, sex workers, and mobile populations.\cite{Tanser2015,Hakim2018,Nyato2019}
Moreover, non-residents of study communities were excluded from interventions
(including 17\% of enumerated household adults in one trial\cite{Havlir2019})
and all three trials noted substantial migration into/out of study communities.
\cite{Iwuji2018,Havlir2019,Hayes2019}
While widespread UTT scale-up may fill some of these coverage gaps,
equitable access to ART for marginalized and mobile populations remains an open challenge.
\cite{Tanser2015,deGruchy2020}
\par
Given the upstream and complementary role of transmission modelling
to project the impact of ART as prevention,\cite{Eaton2012,Delva2012}
and the critical role of risk heterogeneity in epidemic dynamics,
we sought to critically appraise assumptions and representations of risk heterogeneity
in models assessing ART as prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa via scoping review.
Our objectives were to answer the following research questions.
