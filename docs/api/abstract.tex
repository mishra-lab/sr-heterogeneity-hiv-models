\textbf{Background.}
Transmission models provide complementary evidence to clinical trials about
the potential population-level incidence reduction attributable to ART (ART prevention impact).
Different modelling assumptions about risk heterogeneity may influence projected ART prevention impacts.
We sought to review representations of risk heterogeneity in compartmental HIV transmission models
applied to project ART prevention impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa.
\textbf{Methods.}
We systematically reviewed studies published before January 2020 that used
non-linear compartmental models of sexual HIV transmission
to simulate ART prevention impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa.
We summarized data on model structure/assumptions (factors) related to risk and intervention heterogeneity,
and explored multivariate ecological associations of ART prevention impact with modelled factors.
\textbf{Results.}
Of 1384 search hits, 94 studies were included;
64 studies considered sexual activity stratification and 39 modelled at least one key population.
21 studies modelled faster/slower ART cascade transitions (HIV diagnosis, ART initiation, or cessation) by risk group,
including 8 with faster and 4 with slower cascade transitions among key populations versus the wider population.
In ecological analysis, scenarios with risk heterogeneity that included turnover of higher risk groups
were associated with smaller ART prevention benefits. Scenarios that captured differences in ART cascade across risk groups also influenced the projected ART benefits (e.g. 
ART prioritized to key populations was associated with larger ART prevention benefits). %SM: use "assocaition" language since did not examine causality 
Zero scenarios had considered lower ART coverage among key populations. %SM: correct? I think if correct, we should include in abstract as that is a key finding.
\textbf{Conclusion.}
Among compartmental transmission models applied to project ART prevention impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa,
representations of risk heterogeneity and projected impacts varied considerably. Findings highlight a need to 
capture risk heterogeneity with turnover and 
cascade differences amongst risk groups when projecting ART prevention impacts.
