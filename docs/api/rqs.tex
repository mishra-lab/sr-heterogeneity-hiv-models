Among non-linear compartmental models of sexual HIV transmission
used to simulate the prevention impacts of ART in SSA:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{rq:1}
      In which epidemic contexts (geographies, populations, epidemic phases)
      have these models been applied?
\item\label{rq:2}
      How was the model structured to represent key factors of risk heterogeneity?
\item\label{rq:3}
      What are the potential influences of representations of risk heterogeneity
      on the projected prevention benefits of ART in the overall population?
\end{enumerate}
