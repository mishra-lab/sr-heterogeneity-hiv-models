Among dynamical compartmental models of HIV transmission
that have been used to simulate ART for prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In which epidemic contexts (geographies, populations, epidemic phases)
      have these models been applied?
\item How was the model structured to represent key factors of risk heterogeneity?
\item What are the potential influences of representations of risk heterogeneity
      on the projected prevention benefits of ART?
\end{enumerate}
